# Computer Vision: From Scratch to Tracking 🚀

This repository documents the first steps into the world of Computer Vision, covering a learning journey from basic image processing techniques to complex object tracking algorithms. The projects are developed based on the principle of combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications (e.g., Green Bottle Cap Tracking).

## 🎓 Learning Goals
-   Digital image manipulation at the pixel and color space (BGR, HSV) levels.
-   Usage of morphological operators for noise removal and structural analysis.
-   Object detection using contour analysis and geometric properties (Circularity, Area).
-   Designing stable systems with data smoothing algorithms (EMA Filter).

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
-   **Language**: Python 3.x
-   **Libraries**: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision), NumPy (Numerical Python)
-   **Hardware**: Standard Web Camera
